		/may have to use QPianter isntead of teh Annotation too. to draw rects which could be basses as a 'Cropped' mat to the actual Object detection handling/
		/ it may also be the acse that the annotation tool only simply provides the numebr of annotation and the Coords of the drawn rect to the said annotations file .txt
			In this acse the paramaters returned in the Output file are the number of Annnots and the X,y the top lefy and bottom right

			Apparent;u thies eRect mats are then passe to the opencv_traincascade backend to crarry out teh actual cascade training Object detection

found that the cerate samples and cascade trainer app backend toolsare not included with openCV 4 builds

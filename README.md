# QApp

Very outdated QT5 application originally written in earlier 2020 as a University assignment to test using the OpenCV library/API. 

Uses very outdated toolchains, bad Qt/C++ practices and very sloppy patch notes and documentation/comments due to a tight deadline and using copious Copy/pasted code from Qt Documentation that I didn't fully understand at the time.

This may however be used as a reference if a GUI Framework/APi such as QT5/6 is ever used in the future at some point.

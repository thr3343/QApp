to prevent assert failures and crashes:

	 Paths in negatives file must be manually updated to reflect actual directory as they do not auto update automatically
		The same also applies to the test annotation file
	
	Clicking/pressing buttons when not selecting crops can cause invalid pixel coords from being added to the annotations file which also causes the Sample generator to fail
	
	If object name label is added and does not match/find any the name of given folder in tools/<objName>/data it will stall with an assert failure
		this also applies to new objects as a new folder in this location must be created exactly matching the chosen object label, as the application was never configured/programmed to create new folder directories due to time constraints a
	
	Crops can be drawn beyond the dims of the bitmap which typically leads to out of bounds crashes
	
	Drawing crops from bottom-left to top-right will assume the annotation pixel coords will assume the crop is drawn from the top-left corner instead which will likely care invalid/Out Of Bounds crops
